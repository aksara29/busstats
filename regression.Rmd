# Question
A large retailer that sells food and a variety of other products. The retailer has conducted a trial of a new store layout and signage design. It is hoped that this redesign will increase sales. The trial was implemented in roughly half of stores, which were selected at random. The data on the sales in each
store for the last full reporting period prior to the trial being implemented (“sales_1”), and for the first fullreporting period after the change was made (“sales_2”). The retailer operates 3 different types of store, the type for each store is indicated in “outlettype”. The variable “intrial” indicates whether the outlet was selected to be in the trial (TRUE) or not (FALSE), and the staff_turnover variable indicates the proportion of staff working at that outlet that left during the period the data covers.

## Q1
* Did the new store layout and signage change average sales? We will examine this in terms of the change in GPB and the change as a percentage. 

## Q2
We will validate the effect of the trial on sales. Was there a different effect in different outlet types, and does adding staff turnover as a predictor improve the model?

+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Change in layout and signage positively affects sales gain i.e. sales improvement, both in terms of actual numbers and growth rate (%).

For actual numbers, stores with layout change are predicted to gain higher sales than those without the change by 439,508 GBP in average with 95% CI [293,926 - 585,090], t(494) = 5.93, p \< 0.0001, which is demonstrated in figure 1.

![Figure 1: Actual Sales Gain Prediction from Regression](Figure_1.png){width="50%"}

This is because the average of sales improvement for the stores with the change (trial) is 430,529 GBP, 95% CI [329,260 - 531,797] while the average of sales gain for those without the change (non-trial) is -8,979 GBP, 95% CI [-113,568 - 95,610]. The summary of estimated actual sales is depicted in figure 2.

![](Figure_2.png)

Moreover, figure 3 shows that average sales growth rate of stores as trial group is estimated to be higher than the outlets without the change (non-trial group) by 1.42% with 95% CI[0.60 - 2.25], t(494) = 3.39, p \< 0.001. The estimated mean of the growth rate of trial group is 1.43%, 95% CI [0.86, 2.00] whereas for the non-trial group, the predicted mean of the growth rate is 0.005%, 95% CI [-0.59 - 0.60].

![Figure 3: Sales Growth Rate Prediction from Regression](Figure_3.png){width="50%"}

Nevertheless, actual sales prediction is relatively preferred more than sales growth rate since the R-squared is higher, 0.07 vs. 0.02 respectively. This indicates that trial status is able to explain more on the prediction compared with sales growth rate estimation. Note that the R-squared values from both predictions are low signifying that there should be more predictors to help describe the sales.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 2 Section 1

Adding staff turnover is not useful for sales gain prediction, where F(1,489) = 1.25, p = 0.26 from variance analysis. Besides, the correlation between staff turnover and actual sales gain is completely low, at -0.09 as illustrated in figure 4, signifying that there is no relationship between staff turnover proportion and sales gain.

![Figure 4: Correlation](Figure_4.png)

As a result, using trial and outlet types as predictors is more appropriate. From figure 5, the effect of trial status significantly varies across outlet types, F(2, 490) = 34.62, p \< 0.0001. This is applicable only for superstore and community store types. For example, the average sales gain for trial group is the highest at 1,355,741 GBP in superstores with 95% CI [1,158,831 - 1,552,651] while there is no effect of trial on city centre stores.
